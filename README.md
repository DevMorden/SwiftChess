Chess game with a GUI

I wrote this game of chess in my second year of University to practice Java and inheritance. In the game, you are the white pieces and you're playing against a simple or hard AI.
The simple AI just makes random moves while the hard AI calculates all it's possible moves (only 1 step ahead) and determines the best one to perform.
When I first built it, I used the console as the user interface. You would choose what piece you want to move by inputting an x and y coordinate and then choosing where you want to put it in the same way.
Then the gameLogic would check if the move was valid and move it if it was. 
Now, I've added a GUI which simplifies the whole process by making everything buttons and much more enjoyable!

The game is built as an Model-View-Controller (MVC) which makes the transition to a GUI much easier as I only need to change the interface and none of the logic.

# How it was built


# How to install
All of my code is available, but you only need to download the .jar file if you want to play it and test it out. ADD STEPS ON HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND PLAY
You must have Java 17+ downloaded on your machine for it to run.
